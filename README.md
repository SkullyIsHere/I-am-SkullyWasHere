- Hello there, I'm SKu11y.
- I don't know how to code but I'm learning.
- I'm currently learning how to code.
- I am attempting to create JARVIS on github, that's really my main goal on GitHub. It of course will take some time (a lot of time).
- I am also going to make a fun, customizable typing website.
